About five years ago, my wife and I decided to start learning Spanish. It was admittedly an odd time to do it. We had just moved to the Pacific Northwest after years in Texas. Over the last few years we have had tutors, taken classes in Ecuador, bought books, played with apps, subscribed to magazines. Our Spanish is good, but not awesome. I have learned a few things though, and I'm trying to take those things and add to them. On a good day, we might test out at B1, but it wouldn't take much to knock me down to the A levels. 

I have become convinced of a few things as I have progressed. The main one is that one should focus on listening and speaking from day one. I would have been better off if I had never read a word. Of course, that isn't possible in Spanish, it's too common and I have studied it before. The fact is, however, that the key to communication is being able to actually communicate with people, and speech and hearing are key. 

Of course, they are hard, scary, time-intensive, and require help from native speakers, so they are rarely the focus of most teaching. Also, when you get past the beginning levels, it is often hard to find intermediate speaking sources. Real-world examples are often too hard, and creating content that slowly introduces new concepts is tough. I don't think I'm alone in feeling like I'm a bit adrift. 

The best thing we've had to help us through this is our private tutors. However, I want to focus heavily on listening.

These are some of the tools I have found that seem promising:

*Say something in Spanish*: forces you to respond quickly and construct sentences. It seems fantastic. 
*Espa√±ol Automatico*: Karo Martinez's podcast. She talks at a normal speed, the lessons are short, and she provides a transcript. There is enough backlog for me to listen for a year.
*El Curso Magico*: This story-based approach helps teach you vocabulary and grammar by forcing you to reply to questions based on the story. I don't know why I dropped off this for so long. 
*The Mimic Method*: The idea behind this is to have you learn proper pronunciation through song. I need to get back to this. Idahosa's methods are a little different, but his results can't be argued with.
*Fluent Forever*: This is a book, but he strongly recommends proper pronunciation as well as lots of listening. However, he also discusses using Anki to strengthen your vocabulary and grammar, which I think is vital as well. He has an app coming up. 
*FSI Spanish Course*: Specifically the iBooks version. I like them a lot, and I need to seriously consider working through them. They are a big commitment though.
*Italki*: These are private tutors and conversation partners. If I'm ever going to man up and start talking, this is where it will be. 
*Voice of America*: it literally makes no sense that I'm not listening to these every day.
