Not to good of a job updating, but I've gotten a few things done.

#### Home
Got a new dresser in place, and we got a few things cleaned out. I got a new battery for my tools, so should be able to get the new hooks hung under the deck. I'll knock out the kitchen and bathrooms tomorrow. We're really due for a Kondo cleanup.

#### Spanish
Did a Say Something in Spanish lesson, but need to get going with some more structure. December will be here in no time.  

#### Tech Skills
I've done a little VIM work. I got the book Practical Vim, which seems promising. I've got to get on the website stuff.

#### Health and Fitness
Nothing really. I haven't eaten disaster-level terrible, and my weigt is down a bit. We'll see what it is in the morning. I got some new boots. They felt alright in the store, but it is definitely a different feel from anything I've worn in a while. I think they're going to be good, especially considering the wet times I've got coming up. I need to start hiking. 

#### Writing
Have stalled, but getting back to this is helpful. 

#### Art & Creativity
Nothing. 

#### Personal Growth, Reading, Spirituality
Read some American Gods. Also have continued on P&P in Spreeder. In Spanish I'm reading Prince Caspian.
