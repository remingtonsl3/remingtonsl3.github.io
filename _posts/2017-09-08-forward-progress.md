Since I last posted, things have changed a bit. I am not actively searching for work. I'm not *avoiding* looking a jobs, but it is not a priority. My wife and I are lucky enough to not need a second income right now, and there are definite benefits to my being able to match Emily's schedule and take care of things around here. My getting a job that locks me in to a schedule would pretty much trash our travel plans. Not that it couldn't be worth it, but it is a real opportunity cost that must be considered. 

From the outside, this looks like no change whatsoever. Not having a job and taking care of stuff around here has kind of been my gig for the past five years. The difference to us is huge. Any type of project I started, any subject I wanted to study, they always were under the shadow of *the real job search*. Now, this is my job, same result, different mindset. This is an option that might not be available for ever, so it is vital I don't waste it (as I have for the past few years).

How does all that relate to my plans for this blog? Well, for one, my plan is to improve myself in several areas of my life. Most of these have been part of my life for a while, but I haven't moved forward on most of them. I am using this blog as an accountability measure. This will undoubtedly result in an annoying *Dear Diary* feel to it at the beginning, but since I expect the readership to hover somewhere in the 2 readers range (&plusmn;1), I'm not too worried. Still, it should be a useful tool for me. If this develops a different way, I'll delete the annoying crap. Initially, I plan on writing daily to report my status on the several areas I plan to work on. Perhaps this will switch to weekly reports, perhaps some topics will require full articles themselves. In fact, I might do some articles early on about each topic. However, the priority right now will be to regularly update the blog, which is something I have failed to do in past attempts.

What are this areas I am going to track? Here's the current list.

##Home
This is the "job" that needs to be done if any of this makes sense. Put all homemaker duties in here, along with landscaping, maintenance, network administration, etc. If I get a J-O-B, this stuff gets outsourced again. Every job I do is effectively tax-free income if we don't do this. 

##Spanish
My wife and I are learning Spanish. We have traveled, and plan to travel, in Spanish-speaking countries. There is a better-than-even chance that we will spend some of our retirement somewhere where they speak Spanish. Our country has millions of Spanish speakers, and we'd like to be able to communicate with them. 

##Tech Skills
I have quite a few practical skills, but I want a broader base. I'm starting with Free Code Camp, a tech bootcamp style program available for free. I expect that I'll do some other things as well. As one would expect, "tech skills" bleed over into a lot of things. If I develop an interest in something that requires more focus, I'll make its own topic. Publishing this blog, learning how to use git, Jekyll, and vim are all part of this skill. 

##Health and Fitness
I'm old and porky, and want to change that. I'll talk about diet and exercise here. Not planning to make this a food blog, but we'll see. 

##Writing
I do have a degree in Tech Writing, and a desire to make writing my career. This blog will see the result of some of this, but I'll also report on my other efforts to develop a career. 

##Personsal Growth, Reading, Spirituality
OK, this one will change, but at the beginning it will relate my reading, meditation, and rando self-help activities. This will certainly spawn other topics, but I'll use it as a catch-all for the moment. 

Well, that will do for today. Tomorrow will be a brief one, but I'll try to get the formal straight.
