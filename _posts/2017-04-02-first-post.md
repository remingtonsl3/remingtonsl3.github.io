This is my first post on this site. This site may become much more, but at the moment the primary purpose is to give me an opportunity to learn Jekyll, git, and get a little markdown practice. I wouldn't get too attached to anything here, because I will change, delete, or rollback things as I learn. I'd like this to be my regular blogging platform, but we're not quite there yet. If you're reading this, it must mean that I figured out how to push this to github pages.
