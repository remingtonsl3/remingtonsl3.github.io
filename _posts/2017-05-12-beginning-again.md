So I obviously haven't been keeping up with a daily blogging regimen. I have kept up with my Morning Pages, but I don't intend on being a receptacle for those. So what do I want to do with this site?

As I mentioned, the primary purpose was simply to figure out how to use Jekyll and make static pages. I intend on doing more of that, with the intent of figuring out how to do more with the themes and config files. There is a lot to do though, so we'll see. Also, I plan on using this as a place to force myself to write regularly. Not a portfolio, but more a discussion of what I'm learning. I thought this would be a good place to give regular updates about what I'm trying to learn and how I'm going about doing it. This post will ramble a lot, sorry about that.

I've recently graduated with a degree in technical writing. I'm not overjoyed with the possibility of getting a terrible job with a company with no vacation and a boring, repetitive workload. On the other hand, I'm more than willing to put up with occasional stretches of drudgery if I'm working somewhere with interesting work. However, I find myself in the position of having plenty of brains and a nice, new degree, but not much real-world experience to go with it. I've had a few interviews that didn't pan out (with zero feedback as to why), and I'm definitely a little older than the average person looking for an entry-level job. I don't mean to be all "woe is me," but it doesn't help one's confidence when one is older than every person they interview with. The real issue is lack of experience, and I don't need to be told that I should have been working harder to get that over the last couple years while I was in school. However, I am where I am, and I'm trying to work with that.

I learned a lot of skills over the last couple years, but I never fell in love with anything that made it a passion. The good part of that is that I can consider any job. The problem is that looking for any job has made me jump from interview to interview trying to learn a different set of skills for each one--DITA yesterday, grant writing today, Flare tomorrow (time to download the trial!). This is obviously a little frustrating, but is a natural result of not having a focus. Also, it is a bit of a hint of what I want to do.

The fact is that I find all those topics--and dozens more--fascinating. I could see myself doing any of them for quite a while. They would be challenging, and if I got paid to learn about them, all the better.

What I'd really like to do is find a job that allows me to explore all those topics in a way that allows me to investigate at the depth that interests me, and then move on. This is one superficial way to look at freelance writing. Save the "you're an idiot if you think that's what freelance writing is talk." I know that, which is exactly why most of my professional efforts are aimed at learning what a freelance career would entail, and in figuring out what I need to do to get there. At the same time, I'm still looking for good, old fashioned J-O-Bs. Not as a fallback, but as real opportunities to do exciting work that you can really only do at a company with some size and money. I'll never truly understand managing enterprise-level document control, for example, without being somewhere with thousands of documents and users.

And, yes, I am aware that this is the type of activity that is usually carried out by 15-year-olds in their guidance counselor's office, not 40-somethings with graduate degrees. As I said, I am where I am, and I'm trying to work with that.

Next time, I'll try to talk a little more about the plans and progress.
