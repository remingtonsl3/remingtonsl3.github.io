Technically, I missed a day, but I'm counting this as late Sunday. I wouldn't call it productive, but I got a little bit done.

#### Home
Kept the house straight today, main work was filling the rat ingress with foam and putting out poison. I promise there will be more strategic actvity here soon.

#### Spanish
Didn't do shit. Need to get on this.

#### Tech Skills
I'm typing this on the iPad. That's something. Also, I went through the Vim tutorial  I am working to make it my main editor.

#### Health and Fitness
Another walk with Django. Another day of nothing else.

#### Writing
Did morning pages. A complete mess, but I did them.

#### Art & Creativity
Went to the Against Me show. No personal activity.

#### Personal Growth, Reading, Spirituality
Finished *Pleasure of Reading in the Age of Distraction*. Great, inspiring. Have finished a couple chapters of <title>American Gods</title>. Also, I am on the fifth chapter of <title>Pride and Predjudice</title>, using Spreeder. I'm not sure what place speed reading has in my reading life, but I think it is worth knocking out a book or tow.
