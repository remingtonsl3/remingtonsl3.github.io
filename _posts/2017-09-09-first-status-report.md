Let's see how this goes. Full points for getting it done.

#### Home
Got the kitchen cleaned, but the big thing is that I need to take action on the front porch. The weeds in the back yard are looming as well. I think that reminders on ios might be a way to go for repetitive cleaning tasks, but maybe I should have a schedule. 

#### Spanish
Listened to Kara, but didn't make it all the way through. Emily discussed taking the SIELE before Ecuador. I've got a bunch of Anki cards to do. I need to get focused on listening and speaking. 

#### Tech Skills
Worked on this stuff, figured out how to update some stuff through brew. Need to do the laptop.

#### Health and Fitness
Got Django out for a couple walks. Ate fairly well, had a big salad for lunch. Last night was a beer fest. 

#### Writing
Only writing was for this blog.

#### Art & Creativity
I didn't think about putting concerts in here, but it makes sense. After all, I'd put a museum visit here. We went to see Benjamin Booker. 

#### Personal Growth, Reading, Spirituality
I've been reading *Reading in the Age of Distraction* by Alan Jacobs. It is inspiring me to get more reading done. I should probably begin with American Gods.
